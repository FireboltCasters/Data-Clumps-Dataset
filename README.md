Data-Clumps Deep Dive: A Granular Dataset for Enhanced Software Analysis
</h3>

## About

This repository contains a comprehensive dataset for data-clumps at various levels including file, class, method, field, parameter, and code line. The aim of this dataset is to provide a rich resource for researchers and developers interested in studying and understanding data-clumps in software development.

Unlike unified datasets, this dataset is unique in its focus on data-clumps and its granularity, providing detailed data at multiple levels. This allows for a more in-depth analysis and understanding of data-clumps and their impact on software quality and maintainability.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for a variety of research and practical applications including:

## Data Acquisition
Our dataset is generated using the data-clumps detection tool available at [FireboltCasters/data-clumps](https://github.com/FireboltCasters/data-clumps). This tool is based on the award-winning research paper titled `Live Code Smell Detection of Data Clumps in an Integrated Development Environment`. This paper was honored with the Best Student Paper Award and can be accessed [here](https://www.scitepress.org/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0011727500003464). By leveraging this cutting-edge technology, we've ensured the highest level of accuracy and reliability in our data-clumps detection process.
